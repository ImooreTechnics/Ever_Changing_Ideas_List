# I have been a patient at ChristianaCare since my diagnosis of CNS Lymphoma. Therefore, they expected that I use this app (CBORD® Patient™) to create and order my meals. However, having used the app for months now (I started creating my own meals in June 2024) I can say that with certanty, that I absolutely dispise the app. Both in functionality and in apperance. Here is where I will jot down a list of things I think of fixing in regards to the app, to the point where I may even pitch a brand new idea.

1. A History section where a patient can review a log of orders.
    - I have been collecting the reciepts that get printed out because while I was still recovering from my disease, I couldn't remember exactly what I liked to eat. Yes. That is how bad CNS Lymphoma was for me at first.
    - Something that really bugged me about the CBORD® Patient™ app is that 
2. An option to make pre-set meals.
    - That way, if you are a patient (like me) who orders the same thing evrey day, you don't have to go through the hassle of selecting each item one-by-one
